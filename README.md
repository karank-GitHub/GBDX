GBDX Challenge

The available notebooks are large and they can not be displayed entirely in github. To view the full notebooks you should download them locally to your computer.

5 notebooks are provided, each one performing change detection for a different region. 

We demonstrate change detection results for areas in Egypt, Asia, Brazil and Africa.
