# GBDX
GBDX Challenge

The available notebooks are large and they can not be displayed entirely in github. To view the full notebooks you should download them locally to your computer.

In case the notebooks are not accessible through github, here are the links to the published GBDX Notebooks:

**Africa1** : https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/notebooks/5b4bb5cf2486966ea89b76e9?tab=code

**Africa2** : https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/notebooks/5b4bbd8c2486966ea89b76eb?tab=code

**Egypt** :   https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/notebooks/5b4baf562486966ea89b76e6?tab=code

**Asia** :    https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/notebooks/5b4b916e2486966ea89b76de?tab=code

**Brazil** :  https://notebooks.geobigdata.io/hub/notebooks/5b4bc3592486966ea89b76ed?tab=code

5 notebooks are provided, each one performing change detection for a different region. 

We demonstrate change detection results for areas in Egypt, Asia, Brazil and Africa.


To run the notebooks, you should download the **segnet_model.py** file, as well as the trained weights and the mean and standard deviation of the training dataset:
